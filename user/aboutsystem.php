                The Registrar Archiving and Document Management System (RADMS) is a software system designed to manage documents and records within a registrar's office. This system is often used in educational institutions, where the registrar is responsible for managing student records and other important documents related to the institution's academic programs.

                RADMS provides a centralized database for storing and managing many types of documents, including transcripts, student registration forms, and other administrative documents. The system allows the Head Administrator to create and manage electronic files, ensuring that documents are easily accessible and searchable.
